# DigitalCircularityToolkit
A Grasshopper plugin to facilitate circular/reuse/inventory-driven design workflows, including:
- Extracting principal axes from arbitrary geometry
- Abstractions as primitive lines, planes, boxes, and spheres
- Knolling and alignment
- Shape characterization: LineScore, PlaneScore, BoxScore, SphereScore, RadialSignature
- Fourier shape descriptors (in complex and real coordinates) of radial signatures
- Custom feature vector definitions
- Optimal assignment using the Hungarian matching algorithm
- Visualization tools for assignment
